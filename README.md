# Zork
A text adventure game.

Zork is an interactive fiction computer game. 
It was directly inspired by the first text adventure game, Colossal Cave Adventure, 
written in 1975. Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, 
in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, 
which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), 
but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").

It was originally developed by four members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group:
Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling 
between 1977 and 1979 for the DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer.
